# Moana-
Ok, ok, I see what's happening here
You're face to face with greatness, and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me, it's Maui
Breathe it in
I know it's a lot
The hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demi-god
